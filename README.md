# Berkerly PacMan-AI Project

## Overview
The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

## About this project

In this project I have attempted to solve the fundamental AI algorithm via this game. It is a wonderful fun coding exercise that [UC Berkerly](https://www.berkeley.edu/) has designed for their [Introductory AI](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) class and its free to use for personal and educational use according to their website. However they have requested to all people who will be solving this to NOT post the solution and I will do the same. Instead I will demonstrate my skills with the vidoes and screenshots that I took when I solved the questions. i would also like to thank [UC Berkerly](https://www.berkeley.edu/) professors [John DeNero](http://denero.org/) and [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/) for making this project. It has been a wonderful experience trying to code these algorithm with graphic visuals. One Important thing to note here is that this project is writtten in python2.


## Search Algorithm
In this part they asked us to implement various search algorithm on the pacman. Here's a quick overview of all the search algorithms I implemented
